logos-eventbus(3) - Logos Event Bus
==============================================

## SYNOPSIS

The Event Bus is an `EventEmitter` shared across the session and acts
like a global, asynchronous dispatch system.

## DESCRIPTION

To use the Event Bus, require it:

    var eventbus = new require('eventbus').EventBus();
    
But you will usually want to use the one provided by the session
since that is the only one that other `logos` components will
be listening on. If you have a `session` you can simply do:

    session.eventbus.function(...)
    
[**Plugins**](../api.3.html) are provided various utilities by the
[`Module Manager`](modulemanager.3.html) and do not usually need
to access the bus directly.

### eventbus.addListener(event, listener)

Add a listener for the particular event

    eventbus.addListener('stanza', function(stanza) {
        ...
    });

Note that the arguments passed to the function are specific to
each event and can usually be found in that event's documentation.

### eventbus.emit(event, arg1, arg2, ...)

Emit a event with the arguments to pass to registered listeners.

### Others

For full documentation, see the [node.js](http://nodejs.org/api.html) `EventEmitter` object.
