SASL
====

Bindings to [GSASL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsasl/) for node.js.
Made to implement XMPP, but can be used anywhere.

At the moment the only plan is to support basic server side auth with callbacks

Since I do not currently require any other parts of the SASL API, they will not be implemented.
You are welcome to add them though, please notify me when you do, so that I can pull.
